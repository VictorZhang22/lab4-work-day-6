Sixth entry (20/1/2021 6:20pm – 7:30pm (70 minutes)):
Today I figured out problem 7. I did it because I spotted an error when I was using a for loop. I wanted to go through every number, so I simply wanted the program to add 1 to the number I am currently testing. But I should have put the plus one line at the beginning of the while loop instead of the if statement. The while loop was set so that the list that will contain the answers will be smaller than 10001, which will give me the answer to the problem. After I ran the program, I started getting very weird numbers such as 20005, which is not a prime number. I then had to modify my isprime function because it was wrong. After that, I ran the function again but this time the function returned a long list with 10001 elements. I then entered the biggest one into the Project Euler website, but it did not work. That was when I realized that by setting the starting number as 2, I am skipping 2 and starting with 3. The list also proved to be starting with 3. So, I changed the start to 1, and then ran the function again. This time it worked very well, and I took the last element. I then wrote this: [-1], which will print the last element in the list, so I will not have to look at the list myself. 
After I finished problem 7, I started doing problem 8. I thought that problem 8 was interesting because it is like lab3, where I had to splice the list. Only this time, I decided to write the 1000-digit number as an integer. I have not gotten any success with the function because it is tricky to work with a big integer, but I have faith that I will be able to crack this problem. 
Overall, I think today went very well. I was able to troubleshoot myself and find out what kind of problems I am having with my code.
